# Acceleration Logs

Our robot has a problem with wobbling and not driving straight, so this tool was to read the acceleration values from the accelerometer and see if these values could be used to adjust motor power in the wheels to correct movement.

Unfortunately... the accelerometer values were too unreliable for movement correction to be implemented.
